# Speed Clicker Game

A simple web-based clicking game to test your clicking speed.

## Game Rules

1. The game starts with two options: "Click" or "Exit"
2. If you select "Exit", the game will try to close (browser restrictions may prevent this)
3. If you select "Click", the game will start
4. You need to click 100 times anywhere on the screen as fast as possible
5. After completing 100 clicks, you'll receive a message comparing your speed to an animal:
   - Under 10 seconds: "You are as fast as a cheetah"
   - Under 20 seconds: "You are as fast as a horse"
   - Under 40 seconds: "You are as fast as a buffalo"
   - More than 40 seconds: "You are as fast as a tortoise"
6. You can then restart the game to try and improve your time
